                <p class="focus-text pars">These costs include various forms of advertising including newspaper and television & radio ads as well as the cost of prints of the film that are projected in theatres. Venturastic will arrange financing for print and advertising costs for the theatrical release of feature motion pictures. Venturastic will evaluate completed motion pictures for such investments and also makes forward commitments for P&A at the time of production financing – in instances where Venturastic is financing production costs or is a part of other production financing arrangements. Forward commitments as this will enable producers to obtain higher presales and GAP financing as part of their production financing structure.</p>
